/**
 * <p>
 * This Project utilizes vision systems to detect and decode AprilTags in order to compute the
 * robot position.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Three example uses of Vision using different targeting strategies are included as commands:
 * <p>
 * 1. Turn the robot to a target and drive to a specified distance from the target (yaw and pitch
 * of the robot wrt the AprilTag) {@link AlignToReefTagRelativeArcade2D} (activated by XBox
 * controller B button {@link RobotContainer#configBButton()})
 * <p>
 * Heed the caution in this example targeting command about the limitations of the distance
 * calculation and a circumvention.
 * <p>
 * 2. Drive the robot to a specified field position (3-D pose of the robot in the field)
 * {@link AlignToReefFieldRelativePose3D} (activated by XBox controller A button {@link
 * RobotContainer#configAButton()})
 * <p>
 * This (swerve) drive command is presented in two forms:
 * <p>
 * a. use of three PID controllers to achieve the target position goal with a stub drivetrain
 * receiving the motor commands
 * <p>
 * b. proposed, but untested as packaged herein, PathPlanner on the fly command to drive to position
 * <P>
 * 3. Drive the robot to a specified position relative to the target (Transform3d). This is similar
 * to example #2 but instead of using field coordinates it uses a displacement from a target.
 * {@link AlignToReefTargetRelativeTransform3D} (activated by XBox controller X button {@link
 * RobotContainer#configXButton()})
 *
 * <p>
 * These example commands are limited to aligning with a single selected target near 2025 Reefscape
 * reef AprilTag #10.
 * <p>
 * Completed team code should include the robot drivetrain, odometry and a gyro is extremely useful
 * for pose accuracy and drivability of the robot.
 * <p>
 * PID and timeout parameters must be tuned for each robot/drivetrain. Examples are for the
 * hand-driven camera.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This project is a wrapper called {@link VisionContainer} for three lower level wrappers
 * {@link ControllerVision} {@link PhotonVision} {@link LimelightVision} of three complex vision
 * systems - WPILib, PhotonVision, and LimelightVision.
 * 
 * After selecting and configuring the desired vision system as described below, use the robot pose
 * as in an example commands {@link AlignToReefFieldRelativePose3D} or {@link
 * AlignToReefTagRelativeArcade2D} or {@link AlignToReefTargetRelativeTransform3D}
 * 
 * <p>
 * See {@link VisionContainer} as an example of code to instantiate each of the three vision
 * systems and use the RobotPose provided by each of the vision classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each of the three wrappers for the three vision system also may be used without benefit of the
 * simple VisionContainer wrapper. Doing so allows use of more methods in the individual vision
 * system wrapper. And there is no requirement to use any of these wrappers. Each vision system has
 * a complex set of methods to perform a lot of functions. These wrappers make it easier to get
 * started quickly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * PhotonVision and LimelightVision each have examples of their usage on their web sites. Most
 * teams have Vision code; there are hundreds of varieties. This code helps beginner or novice
 * teams get started quicker and gives hints of some possibilities to use vision and commands.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Presentation of three Vision systems:
 * <p>
 * WPILib Vision example (known herein as ControllerVision) with an example wrapper consistent with
 * the other two wrappers
 * <p>
 * Example wrapper for PhotonVision
 * <p>
 * Example wrapper for LimelightVision
 * <p>
 * Each system puts robot pose information to the NetworkTables and that can be viewed in
 * AdvantageScope or other viewers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These three Vision routines each can detect AprilTags and compute a robot pose. Select the one
 * to run in {@link RobotContainer#RobotContainer()}
 * <p>
 * This project may be used in whole by selecting which one of the three vision systems to be
 * demonstrated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each of the Visions Systems must be configured for the "camera" name and minimum parameters
 * needed for each system.
 * <p>
 * Each has its mounted camera location wrt the robot that must be provided by the team (example
 * default provided). {@link VisionContainer}
 * <p>
 * The ControllerVision (completely run on the roboRIO) must also have the chosen camera
 * calibration parameters specified herein (a few examples provided). {@link
 * ControllerVision#ControllerVision()}
 * <p>
 * ControllerVision arbitrarily selects to use the robot pose of the lowest AprilTag number, if
 * there are multiple tags in view in a frame. That is likely wrong a lot of the time. Some smarts
 * need to be added so targeting goes to the right target; see {@link ControllerVision#getPose3d()}
 * and below it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Use of PhotonVision or LimelightVision require that those devices and software be setup as
 * instructed in their respective documentation. They are mostly configured through their
 * respective "dashboards."
 * <p>
 * Use of Limelight MegaTag2 requires the robot heading (gyro value) be sent to LL on each
 * iteration. {@link LimelightVision#update()}
 * <p>
 * Selection of the best pose from LimelightVision requires filtering. Simple example is presented.
 * {@link LimelightVision#update()}
 * <p>
 * Selection of the very best pose estimate from PhotonVision requires using {@link
 * PhotonVision#getEstimatedGlobalPose(Pose2d)}. A commented dummy stub is included to give a
 * starting hint of what could be done but wasn't in this project. Otherwise, the simpler
 * "bestTarget" as used in this project is a good approximation.
 * <p>
 * Use of the WPILib PoseEstimator requires that values from this vision targeting project be
 * merged with the gyro and wheel odometry positions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This demonstration project may be run in simulation mode or on a roboRIO. The cameras are not
 * simulated. That is, no roboRIO is required but the roboRIO simulation may be used with one of
 * the following attached (USB or network) to the PC running simulation:
 * <p>
 * a camera attached to the simulation PC,
 * <p>
 * a LimelightVision box attached to the same network as the simulation PC,
 * <p>
 * PhotonVision running on some device - the simulation PC or a coprocessor attached to the same
 * network as the simulation PC.
 *
 * <p>
 * This code has been tested with Limelight 2+ limelight2_2025_1_release, PhotonVision
 * v2026.0.1-beta on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.2, PhotonVision v2026.0.1-beta on Windows 11, and
 * WPILib 2025.3.2; all with both a roboRIO v1 and DriverStation PC simulation.
 * <p>
 * Targeting commands were driven by a hand-held camera without benefit of a robot.
 * <p>
 * Cameras used were Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 (USB interface) and ArduCam UC-844 Rev. B (OV9281
 * camera sensor; USB interface).
 * <p>
 * Gyro was simulated with a "0" heading and "0" rate.
 * <p>
 * Drivetrain was crudely simulated by printing the commanded velocity and voltage values and PWM
 * motor controllers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that a significant amount of logging is turned on including @Logged annotation, datalog to
 * a file and terminal output. These are examples and not required for correct vision operation.
 * There are some helpful examples of debugging prints in the code most but not all of which are
 * commented out. Command execution summary logging and spike removal are printed as are fake
 * drivetrain data. Pose alignment discrepancies are printed so the human can pretend to drive (the
 * camera) to the target.
 * 
 * <p>
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * <p>
 * -----Setting up simulation of the roboRIO on the PC-----
 * <p>
 * Get the ip address of the PC running the simulation by command prompt program "ipconfig" (linux
 * command is "ifconfig"). If the IP address isn't correct initially causing a connection issue in
 * simulation or real, no harm is done and this program provides some guidance to correctly enter
 * the team number and lists the IP address on the terminal.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Optional for the curious: Start Outline Viewer on the PC and change Options/settings/team/IP
 * 127.0.0.1 (or localhost or the PC IP address) - client nt4 mode and apply
 * <p>
 * For PhotonVision start the device/program and change Settings Team Number/NetworkTables Server
 * Address to the PC IP address PV needs to see the Server
 * <p>
 * For LimelightVision start the device and change Settings Custom NT Server IP: to the PC IP
 * address LL needs to see the Server
 * <p>
 * For ControllerVision plugin the camera into the PC
 * <p>
 * AdvantageScope start the program and select File / Connect to Simulator
 * <p>
 * Start the "Simulate Robot Code" on the PC
 * <p>
 * This is not simulating the camera device; that is not supported in this project. A real camera
 * device must be used. Only the roboRIO is being simulated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example of camera simulation is available (with limitations) in PhotonVision only.
 * <p>
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * <p>
 * Cameras that allow manual focus must be checked and focused. It's easy to focus a camera by eye
 * or use the PhotonVision focus function or the LimelightVision focus pipeline for its own camera.
 * A Siemens Star can be used or any object at about the typical distance that the camera is to be
 * used. Mark the lens holder where the camera is focused and glue into place if it's prone to
 * moving.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Autofocus sounds like a good idea but some inexpensive cameras jitter violently trying to focus
 * continuously especially while the camera is moving (with the robot, of course). Autofocus likely
 * is more harmful than helpful.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Cameras need to be calibrated - creating a camera matrix at the desired resolution. Calibrate
 * using PhotonVision and copy its camera matrix from the downloaded setting file or try this
 * online calibration database and calibrator https://www.calibdb.net/ . LimelightVision includes
 * a calibration process for its own camera.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For team's customized use, it is fairly easy to copy the code of one or more of the vision
 * systems into a team's own project.
